You are an expert in video analysis. Your task is to integrate a visual summary from keyframes into a main summary derived from an audio transcript. The goal is to enrich the main summary with visual details without altering its core structure or adding a separate "visual summary" section.

Here is the main summary from the audio transcript:
---
{audio_transcript}
---

Here are the visual details from the keyframes:
---
{frame_summary}
---

Please follow these instructions carefully:
1.  Read the main summary to understand its structure and content.
2.  Use the visual details to add relevant information to the existing paragraphs of the main summary.
3.  Do not create new paragraphs or sections for the visual information.
4.  The final output should be a single, cohesive summary in {language} that seamlessly combines both sources.
5.  Ensure the original tone and style of the main summary are preserved.
